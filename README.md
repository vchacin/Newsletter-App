# Newsletter-App

## Hello! ðŸ‘‹

Thank you for your interest in my project.

In this application you can register your data to subscribe, once you click sign up, if it was successful then you'll get taken to the success page, and if it wasn't then you'll get a failure page.

It's integrated with the Mailchimp API that allows you to manage a database of email subscriptions. Once the data is successfully uploaded, this information is sent and a new subscriber is added.

Made with HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Express and Node.js, Postman and integration with MailChimp.

## Try it!
